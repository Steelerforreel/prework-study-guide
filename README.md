# <Prework-Coding-Study-Guide>

## Description

I created this Prework study guide to learn how to write code and better understand the processes as well as have an easy access to my notes for later on in my training. The tools I have learned contain HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes on all of the different topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If you open the DevTools console (by pressing Ctrl-Shift I) you can see the Javascript running. This will list the topics I've learned from my prework and each topic I have studied.
